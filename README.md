It was made to concatenate (to merge) a bunch of PNGs in directory into a single file with given side proportion like 3x4 4x5 9x16.
Maybe i will extend it to work with other type of files.
Maybe i will make it work properly on any given side proportion (it does not for some reason) 

###### QUICK GUIDE 
-
+ You have yourself a nice little directory filled with pictures (I made it for telegram stickers, downloaded with this gentleman's [repository](https://github.com/Cartmanishere/telegram-sticker-downloader)
+ You run this .py file within this directory (MAYBE i'll make a directory selector (probably not)) 
+ it creates a /results/ directory and saves a result image inside it (works on windows, never tested in linux file system, probably won't work, idc (maybe will fix))
